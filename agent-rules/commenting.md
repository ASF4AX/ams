# Commenting Guide for Agents

Write comments to explain why the code exists or behaves a certain way.

## When to Comment
- Business logic or non-obvious intent
- External constraints or unexpected conditions

## How to Comment
- Use block comments for intent and context
- Use inline comments only when essential
- Use docstrings for public functions and classes

## Avoid
- Describing what is already clear in code
- Outdated or misleading comments
- Over-commenting trivial logic
