# Documentation Agent Guidelines

- Focus edits on the "## Current Goal" and "## Task List" sections of `docs/plan.md`.
- Use `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks.
- Keep descriptions concise; avoid unrelated text.
- Maintain formatting and ordering of existing items.
- Write a brief statement for the current goal; avoid listing past actions and do not use a log style.
- Summarize long lists of completed tasks to highlight key milestones rather than listing every change.
